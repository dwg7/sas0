# Decisions

Why sas0 is built the way it is. Numbered so other docs and commit messages can point at a specific entry (`see D3`).

## D1: Open MCT is loaded from a CDN, not vendored

sas0 is a zero-build static site (`docs/` served as-is by GitHub Pages), and the [original prompt](https://github.com/dwg7/sas0/pull/1) that kicked off this project explicitly ruled out backend/build infrastructure. Loading `openmct.js`/`espressoTheme.css` from unpkg keeps the repo free of a multi-MB vendored `dist/`, at the cost of a few CDN-specific integration issues — see D2–D5.

## D2: The Open MCT version is pinned to an exact, verified-to-exist release

The version that first shipped in PR #1 (`openmct@3.3.0`) does not exist on npm/unpkg — the CDN URL 404'd, so nothing loaded at all. `docs/index.html` currently pins `openmct@4.3.0-rc1` (bumped from the initial fix's `4.2.0` once the RC was confirmed to work end-to-end — see D8).

**Before bumping this version**, verify both of these resolve (a 404 on either means a silent blank page, since `docs/app.js` doesn't surface CDN load failures beyond a generic "Open MCT failed to load" throw):

```bash
curl -sI "https://unpkg.com/openmct@<version>/dist/openmct.js"
curl -sI "https://unpkg.com/openmct@<version>/dist/espressoTheme.css"
```

Note the CSS file is `espressoTheme.css`, not `openmct.css` — that filename changed at some point between the 3.x and 4.x series and isn't obvious from the package name.

## D3: `window.SharedWorker` is disabled before Open MCT loads

Open MCT's built-in search indexer (`InMemorySearchProvider`) unconditionally starts a `SharedWorker` pointed at its own asset path — i.e. the CDN origin (`unpkg.com`), not the site's own origin (`dwg7.github.io`). Browsers block constructing a `SharedWorker` from a cross-origin script URL, which throws a synchronous `SecurityError` inside `openmct.start()` and aborts the whole bootstrap before anything renders.

Open MCT already has a fallback for this exact situation (`typeof SharedWorker === 'undefined'` → synchronous local-index search, meant for iOS which lacks `SharedWorker`). `docs/index.html` deliberately forces that fallback:

```js
window.SharedWorker = undefined;
```

This is the CDN-loading equivalent of iOS's own constraint — Open MCT already handles the "no SharedWorker" case, it just doesn't know that a cross-origin CDN load needs the same treatment. The tradeoff is losing background/threaded search indexing; sas0 has exactly one fixed non-searchable object, so this costs nothing here.

## D4: A minor Open MCT search-indexer error is left unaddressed

With D3's fallback active, Open MCT logs one console error at startup — `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'key')` — from somewhere inside the local-search indexing path. It fires exactly once per page load (confirmed by watching the console for several seconds after start), doesn't recur, and doesn't block rendering, tree navigation, or the inspector panel.

This looks like a latent edge case in Open MCT's own local-search fallback (plausibly triggered by indexing the single custom `sas0.console` root object, which lacks fields a normal composed object would have) rather than something sas0's code does wrong. It's left as a known, harmless console error rather than chased further; confirmed still present, unchanged, after the 4.2.0 → 4.3.0-rc1 bump (D8), so it isn't specific to one Open MCT version.

## D5: Open MCT starts in its standard (non-headless) mode, with a router redirect

The first fix attempt used `openmct.startHeadless()` plus manually calling the registered view provider's `show()` — skipping Open MCT's own tree/browse-bar/inspector chrome, to match the "two panels only, no GIS-admin chrome" design intent from the [original prompt](https://github.com/dwg7/sas0/pull/1). That path hit unrelated internal Open MCT errors and never rendered anything.

`docs/app.js` now uses the standard, supported path instead:

```js
openmct.start(document.getElementById('app'));
openmct.on('start', () => {
  openmct.router.setPath(`/browse/${NAMESPACE}:${CONSOLE_IDENTIFIER.key}`);
});
```

This means Open MCT's own browse bar, left-hand tree, and inspector panel are visible around the two custom panels — a real deviation from "calm two-panel mission console, not GIS/admin dashboard." That's a known, accepted tradeoff for now: it's the code path Open MCT actually supports, versus more headless-mode debugging with no guarantee of success. If a chrome-free console remains a goal, the next step is probably CSS to hide/collapse Open MCT's own UI regions rather than bypassing its startup sequence.

## D6: The weather chart is live JMA data, fetched client-side, not a static placeholder

The placeholder URL shipped in PR #1 (`.../thumb/6/6f/Synoptic_weather_map.png/1280px-Synoptic_weather_map.png`) 404'd; it was briefly replaced with a working but still-static Wikimedia Commons file, then replaced again with the Japan Meteorological Agency's actual surface weather chart (天気図) — matching the "designed for future daily integration" intent from the original v0 scope instead of deferring it.

JMA does not publish a stable `latest.png`. `https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/weather_map/data/list.json` is a JSON index of currently-available chart filenames (refreshed every few hours, oldest-first); the actual chart image lives at `https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/weather_map/data/png/<filename>`. Both endpoints send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so `docs/app.js`'s `loadLatestWeatherChart()` can `fetch()` the list client-side and set `<img src>` to `imageBaseUrl + timeline[timeline.length - 1]` (the last, i.e. most recent, entry in `near.now`) — no backend, no build step, no hardcoded filename to go stale.

If that fetch fails (offline, JMA outage, CORS policy change) it fails silently to an empty `<img>` — no fallback image, since JMA is now the only intended source. `weather.imageBaseUrl`/`weather.listUrl` in `docs/config.js` still go through the same `getSafeUrl()` host-allowlist check as any other instrument source (D7).

**Attribution**: JMA content is licensed under Japan's "公共データ利用規約（第1.0版）" (Public Data License v1.0), which requires a specific citation format — `出典：気象庁ホームページ　（当該ページのURL）`. `weather.sourceLabel` in `docs/config.js` uses that exact template and is rendered as a link to `weather.sourceUrl`, deliberately in Japanese even though the rest of the UI is English, since it's a legal citation requirement, not UI copy. Don't reword it.

## D7: Instrument sources are constrained to an explicit host allowlist

`docs/app.js`'s `getSafeUrl()` only assigns `weatherImage.src` / `spiccatoFrame.src` if the URL's protocol is `https:` and its hostname is in `config.js`'s `allowedHosts` for that instrument — otherwise it silently falls back to `''` / `about:blank`. This was already in place from PR #1 and is worth preserving as new instruments are added: `config.js` should never be trusted to only ever contain safe values, since it's the one file most likely to get casually hand-edited later.

## D8: Open MCT is pinned to the current release candidate, and `start()` uses the selector form

Once the D1–D5 fixes were confirmed working end-to-end on `openmct@4.2.0` (the latest non-RC release at the time), the pin was bumped to `openmct@4.3.0-rc1` — the newest release on npm overall — and re-verified against the same checklist (D2), including a fresh check of D3's `SharedWorker` behavior and D4's harmless indexer error, both unchanged.

The bump surfaced one genuine API improvement worth adopting: `openmct.start()` on 4.3 accepts a CSS selector string, not just an `Element`, and defers its own bootstrap until `DOMContentLoaded` if called while the document is still loading. `docs/app.js` now calls `openmct.start('#app')` instead of `openmct.start(document.getElementById('app'))` — one less DOM lookup to keep in sync with `docs/index.html`'s markup, and it degrades to a clear thrown error (rather than a silent no-op) if `#app` is ever removed from `docs/index.html`.

Being on an RC means the next Open MCT release could change or remove that selector-string support before it's finalized — if a future version bump ever throws on `openmct.start('#app')`, that's the first thing to check.

## D9: The Spiccato iframe's sandbox includes `allow-same-origin`

Reported symptom: Spiccato's MapLibre GL JS map didn't render in Brave, and turning off Brave's "Block fingerprinting" Shields setting didn't fix it — ruling out the general WebGL-fingerprinting-protection explanation (Brave issue [#4400](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/4400) and friends).

The actual cause is specific to how this iframe is embedded: `dwg7.github.io/spiccato/` and `dwg7.github.io/sas0/` are the same origin in production (origin is scheme+host+port, not path), but `docs/config.js`'s `sandbox` value originally omitted `allow-same-origin`, which forces a sandboxed iframe into an opaque, unique origin regardless of where it's actually served from. Per Brave's own documented behavior, "if an iframe is first party to the top-level origin and the sandbox attribute is set, it will be blocked unless `sandbox="allow-same-origin"` is set" — Brave can't distinguish "deliberately extra-sandboxed same-site content" from "genuinely third-party content," and applies its stricter third-party WebGL/fingerprinting restrictions to the opaque-origin frame either way, independent of the page-level Shields toggle.

Fix: `spiccato.sandbox` in `docs/config.js` is now `'allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin'`, and `getSafeSandbox()`'s token allowlist in `docs/app.js` was extended to permit `allow-same-origin`. This is safe specifically *because* Spiccato is same-origin with sas0 in production — `allow-same-origin` would be a real isolation reduction for a genuinely third-party embed, but grants nothing here that the browser's own same-origin policy wasn't already going to allow.

**Confirmed fixed** in an actual Brave browser after deploying — vector tiles render correctly. The fingerprinting-protection explanation (Brave issue [#4400](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/4400)) was a red herring for this particular report; the sandbox/`allow-same-origin` interaction was the real cause.
